use "quote" branch to compile attach.cpp and get "symbolic execution state"
put the "state" at the head of proof#i() in proof.c

def.h includes some theorems from cstarlib.ml and definitions used in the proof of buddy allocator 
drule.h includes some derived rules
lemma.h includes some lemmas used in the proof of buddy allocator
interface.h includes some operational derived rules that can directly used by C programmers

    some axioms are involved
    subfunctions of __hyp_attach_page are not verified
    some proofs are not are not well modularized
