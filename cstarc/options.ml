(* [c99_scoping] is [true] if using C99/C11/C18 scoping rules, [false] if
   using ANSI scoping rules. *)
(* This flag influences only the ANSI-compatible parser. It should be
   set to [true] for C99/C11/C18 parsing, [false] for C89/C90 parsing. *)
let c99_scoping = ref false

(* [atomic_strict_syntax] is [true] if [_Atomic] followed by an
   opening parenthesis is always a type specifier. *)
(* It should be set to [true] for strictly compliant C18 parsing.
   Setting it to [false] only causes more programs to be accepted; no
   program can be parsed incorrectly. *)
(* This flag directly influences only the lexer. *)
let atomic_strict_syntax = ref true
