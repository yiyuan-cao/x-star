open Context

(* We distinguish between three kinds of declarators: 1- identifiers,
   2- function declarators, and 3- everything else. In the case of a
   function declarator, we save a snapshot of the context at the END
   of the parameter-type-list. *)

(* K&R function declarators are considered part of "other" declarators. *)

| DeclaratorFunction of context
| DeclaratorOther

   identifier that is being declared; 2- the declarator's kind, as
   defined above. *)

}
